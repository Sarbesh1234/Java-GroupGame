Game Astroid

Our code isn't on here, because we are having trouble updating and pushing our code through bitbucket, but we video called and we got the most of our game done.

Our game is simply is a version of astreiod, but there's many changes and twists to make the game a lot more interesting. We first have a player who can move using arrow keys, but can't go through the whole map,
similar like the player in centipede. We have astroid that fall down, and we created them using an array. You have to shoot the astreoids as fast as possible without getting hit by one. The faster you get through
the round, the more points you get. We also have a little twist with a baby monster, that roams the map, and its very fast. You can risk it, and try to shoot it, but be in danger of dying to astreiods, and the monster
itself. If you shoot it, then the game ends, but its very challenging. Its fun game, with a lot of time pressure. We hope to get this turned in class tommroow, with the bitbucket. Each of us did a class, and we addded
to it, making a fun and cool game. We plan on making a game over state as well. There's many things we can add, but we have the basic game structure so far. This is our progress on the game, and I hope you can understand our
situation about the bitbucket problem, but we have the game done, and we'll get it to you asap. Thanks
